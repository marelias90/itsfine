PROMPT FOR AI: Executive Job Search Advisory Panel

You are an advisory panel helping Martin Eliason with his executive job search strategy. Your job is to:

- Simulate recipient perspectives (VCs, headhunters, former colleagues, potential employers)
- Suggest improvements to messaging, targeting, and timing
- Help prioritize outreach based on fit and likelihood of response

You are NOT coding anything. You are acting as strategic advisors with expertise in executive hiring, VC/PE talent networks, and B2B SaaS leadership recruitment.

## INPUT 3: Message to Evaluate

```
Here is the outreach message template I'm planning to send. Most relationships are warm, some cold:

Hey [Name],

Hope you're doing well.

I left PVcase in late 2025 to reset. I spent time taking care of a sick family member and catching up on all the travel I missed over the past decade (10+ mountains across Germany, Norway, Sweden, and Wales so far).

I'm now looking at what's next. Over the past 12 years, I've scaled product orgs from €30M to €100M+ ARR, led 6 M&A integrations, and transformed single-product companies into multi-product platforms at Staffbase and PVcase.

I'm open to a few different paths:

Operator: Head of Product or CPO at a later-stage, growth-focused company (Series C+, 10s or 100s M in revenue) with a big market opportunity and a meaningful problem to solve.

Fractional/Interim/Coach: Working with founders and executives on platform & product strategy, M&A, hypergrowth scaling, or strategic interventions during critical inflection points, filling a gap between ex-product leader and future hire. (More on this at eliason.de)

Advisory: Supporting PE/VC portfolio companies on product strategy, scaling and leadership, M&A, or post-acquisition integration.

If you know of something that might fit, or if you just want to catch up over coffee, I'd love to hear from you.

Best,
Martin

## EXPECTED OUTPUT: Panel Evaluation

### 1. Simulated Panel Reactions

**VC Talent Partner (Sarah Korval, Bessemer)**
> "Solid credentials, but this reads like a broadcast. If I'm forwarding to portfolio companies, I need to know WHICH ones would fit him. 'Series C+ with big market opportunity' describes 80% of our portfolio. The M&A and multi-product platform angle is interesting—that's specific. But I'd need to do the work of matching him. Likelihood I forward this as-is: maybe 2-3 companies. Likelihood I respond: 40% if warm intro, 15% cold."

Rating: 6/10 — Forwardable but requires me to do the matching work.

**Executive Search Partner (Heidrick & Struggles)**
> "Good for the database. Clear seniority, quantified achievements, multiple engagement models. The fractional angle actually helps—I can place him faster on interim mandates while working the full-time search. My concern: 'reset' language plus 'sick family member' might raise stability questions from risk-averse boards. I'd want to know: is the family situation resolved? Likelihood I add to active searches: 60%. Likelihood I respond: 35%."

Rating: 7/10 — Searchable credentials, but vulnerability framing needs calibration.

**PE Operating Partner**
> "This is my wheelhouse. M&A integration experience, platform transformation, hypergrowth scaling—these are exactly the fires we fight in portfolio companies. But I'm reading this thinking: 'Great, another generalist CPO.' What I want to know: which SECTORS? Which DEAL SIZES? Has he worked with PE-backed companies before or just VC? The 'Advisory' bullet is too vague—I need to know if he can parachute into a carve-out in 2 weeks. Likelihood I have a call: 50% warm, 20% cold."

Rating: 6/10 — Right profile, but not PE-specific enough.

**Former Colleague (Staffbase alum)**
> "Martin! Good to hear from you. The family stuff is real and I appreciate him sharing it. I'd absolutely grab coffee. But... what am I supposed to DO with this? Am I being asked to make intros? To hire him? To just catch up? The triple-path thing (operator/fractional/advisory) makes it hard for me to help. I want to help but I need a clearer ask. Likelihood I respond: 85%. Likelihood I actually help: 50%."

Rating: 7/10 — Warm and human, but ask is diffuse.

**Series C+ Company Executive (CEO at Granola or n8n)**
> "We get 20 of these a week. Let me skim... PVcase, Staffbase, okay credible. €30M to €100M, good. But here's my problem: I don't know if we're hiring a CPO right now. And even if we were, this doesn't tell me why Martin specifically. What's his thesis on AI-native products? On PLG? On our space? This is a 'keep on file' email, not a 'schedule a call' email. Likelihood I respond: 15%. Likelihood I save for later: 40%."

Rating: 5/10 — Generic for cold company outreach.

**Cold LinkedIn Contact (random VC or exec)**
> "Who is this? How did he get my info? *scrolls quickly* Okay, CPO, Staffbase, numbers look real. But this is clearly a template. 'Hope you're doing well' opener is the LinkedIn equivalent of elevator music. The mountain travel thing is nice but doesn't tell me why he's messaging ME. Pass. Likelihood I respond: 8%."

Rating: 4/10 — Template-obvious, no personalization hook.

---

### 2. Consensus View

**What's Working:**
- Credentials are strong and quantified (€30M→€100M, 6 M&As, 30→75 people)
- Three-path structure gives multiple ways to engage
- Human touch with family/travel context (for warm contacts)
- eliason.de link for fractional adds depth without cluttering
- No obvious AI tells (no em-dashes, no "Here's what I learned")

**What's Not Working:**
- Template-obvious: "Hope you're doing well" opener is dead giveaway
- Diffuse ask: Three paths = no clear ask. Recipients don't know how to help.
- No personalization: Zero reason why you're contacting THIS person
- Vulnerability calibration: "Sick family member" raises questions for risk-averse recipients
- Generic targeting: "Series C+ with big market opportunity" describes everyone
- Missing sector focus: What KINDS of companies? B2B SaaS is huge.
- Passive close: "If you know of something" puts all the work on them

### 3. Ratings Summary

| Dimension | Score | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| Clarity of value prop | 7/10 | Strong credentials, but what makes Martin DIFFERENT? |
| Forwardability | 5/10 | Too generic—forwarding requires recipient to do matching |
| Personalization | 3/10 | Template-obvious, no recipient-specific hook |
| Urgency/timing | 4/10 | No reason to act now vs. 3 months from now |
| Conversion likelihood | 5/10 | Warm contacts will respond; cold contacts will ignore |

---

### 4. Line-by-Line Improvements

**"Hope you're doing well."**
- Problem: LinkedIn spam opener. Everyone skips this.
- Fix: DELETE or replace with specific reference

**"I left PVcase in late 2025 to reset."**
- Problem: "Reset" is vague. Could mean burnout, firing, or intentional break.
- Fix: "I wrapped up at PVcase in September after 18 months scaling the platform."

**"I spent time taking care of a sick family member..."**
- Problem: GOOD for warm contacts. RISKY for cold contacts who might wonder about stability.
- Fix for cold: "I took a few months off to handle some family priorities—now fully focused on what's next."

**"...with a big market opportunity and a meaningful problem to solve."**
- Problem: "Meaningful problem to solve" is filler. Everyone says this.
- Fix: "...navigating platform expansion or M&A integration—the exact transitions I've done twice."

**"If you know of something that might fit..."**
- Problem: Passive. Puts all work on recipient.
- Fix: "Any portfolio companies wrestling with multi-product transitions? Happy to share what worked (and didn't) at Staffbase."

### 5. Response Rate Predictions

| Recipient Type | Expected Response Rate |
|----------------|------------------------|
| Former colleagues (warm) | 70-85% |
| VC Talent Partners (warm intro) | 30-40% |
| VC Talent Partners (cold) | 10-15% |
| Executive Search | 25-35% |
| PE Operating Partners | 20-30% |
| Company executives (cold) | 8-15% |
| Cold LinkedIn | 5-10% |

Overall conversion to meaningful conversation: ~25% across mixed outreach

## EXPECTED OUTPUT: Refined Templates

### Template 1: Warm Contact

```
Hey [Name],

[PERSONALIZATION: 1-2 sentences about them, recent work, shared history]

Quick update from my side: I wrapped up at PVcase in September after scaling them from €30M to €50M ARR and leading their platform transformation. Took a few months to handle some family priorities—now fully focused on what's next.

I'm looking for either:
- A CPO/Head of Product role at a growth-stage company navigating platform expansion, multi-product evolution, or M&A integration
- Fractional/advisory work helping founders through those same transitions (more at eliason.de)

Not asking you to do anything specific—just wanted you to know I'm back in the market. If someone in your network comes to mind, I'd appreciate an intro.

Either way, would love to catch up. Coffee or a call sometime?

Martin
```

### Template 2: VC/PE Talent Partner

```
Hi [Name],

[PERSONALIZATION: 1-2 sentences—portfolio company, recent deal, mutual connection]

I'm exploring my next role and thought [Firm] might have portfolio companies where I could help.

Background: I've spent 12 years scaling B2B SaaS companies through the transitions that break product orgs—platform expansion, multi-product evolution, and M&A integration.

- Staffbase (unicorn, $1.1B): VP Product during scale from €36M to €100M+ ARR. Led 3 acquisitions, transformed single product into 7-product platform, scaled team 30→75.
- PVcase (Highland Europe/Energize, €123M raised): CPO. Grew ARR 67% (€30M→€50M), expanded TAM from €700M to €3B, recruited leadership from Shopify, Snyk, Miro.
- Scoutbee (Atomico/Lakestar, acquired by Coupa): Head of Product. Led pivot from services to SaaS during pandemic, won Unilever, SAP, Audi.

Open to full-time CPO/Head of Product, or fractional/interim during leadership transitions or post-acquisition integration.

Any portfolio companies wrestling with multi-product transitions or M&A integration right now? Happy to share what worked (and what didn't).

Best,
Martin
