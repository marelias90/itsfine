## INPUT 3: Message to Evaluate

### Template 1: Warm Contact

```
Hey [Name],

[PERSONALIZATION: 1-2 sentences about them, recent work, shared history]

Quick update from my side: I wrapped up at PVcase in September after scaling them from €30M to €50M ARR and leading their platform transformation. Took a few months to handle some family priorities—now fully focused on what's next.

I'm looking for either:
- A CPO/Head of Product role at a growth-stage company navigating platform expansion, multi-product evolution, or M&A integration
- Fractional/advisory work helping founders through those same transitions (more at eliason.de)

Not asking you to do anything specific—just wanted you to know I'm back in the market. If someone in your network comes to mind, I'd appreciate an intro.

Either way, would love to catch up. Coffee or a call sometime?

Martin

### Template 2: VC/PE Talent Partner

```
Hi [Name],

[PERSONALIZATION: 1-2 sentences—portfolio company, recent deal, mutual connection]

I'm exploring my next role and thought [Firm] might have portfolio companies where I could help.

Background: I've spent 12 years scaling B2B SaaS companies through the transitions that break product orgs—platform expansion, multi-product evolution, and M&A integration.

- Staffbase (unicorn, $1.1B): VP Product during scale from €36M to €100M+ ARR. Led 3 acquisitions, transformed single product into 7-product platform, scaled team 30→75.
- PVcase (Highland Europe/Energize, €123M raised): CPO. Grew ARR 67% (€30M→€50M), expanded TAM from €700M to €3B, recruited leadership from Shopify, Snyk, Miro.
- Scoutbee (Atomico/Lakestar, acquired by Coupa): Head of Product. Led pivot from services to SaaS during pandemic, won Unilever, SAP, Audi.

Open to full-time CPO/Head of Product, or fractional/interim during leadership transitions or post-acquisition integration.

Any portfolio companies wrestling with multi-product transitions or M&A integration right now? Happy to share what worked (and what didn't).

Best,
Martin
